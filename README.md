# Final Capstone Project - Us Arrests PCA

This project focuses on the Principal Components Analysis (PCA) of the US Arrests dataset and aims to provide insights and visualization of the data. The dataset contains statistics, in arrests per 100,000 residents for assault, murder, and rape in each of the 50 US states in 1973.

## Contents
The Jupyter Notebook file UsArrests.ipynb contains the following sections:<br>

- Introduction to the data set<br>
- Data exploration and visualisation<br>
- Principal Components Analysis (PCA)<br>

## Requirements
To run this project, you will need to have the following software installed on your computer:

- Jupyter Notebook <Br>
- Python 3 <Br>
- Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SKLearn <Br>
